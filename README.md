Hello, welcome to download these files. These files are the code of Single-Chip Microcomputer I learned in the course from June to July 2022. These codes are based on reg51.h, you can use keil uvision4 to open it, then click the magic wand icon, and then click output - create hex file hex format. Generally, it is hex-80. If not, please correct it, and then click tick in the front to export.
It is based on STC89C51RC. Then, you can run it in Isis 7 professional.
